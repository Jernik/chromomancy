The  Basics
	Chromomancy runs in two threads, the main thread that handles all of the actual game stuff, and the drawingThread, which handles drawing to the screen.

	The main game loop is located inside of DisplayObjects.Display constructor. Inside of the main game loop, the method step() is called. Step() calls all of the sub-step classes, checks collisions, and basically takes care of all updates. 

Just about every class has a class field “public DisplayObjects.Display D;”
This enables every object to access and manipulate the data of every other object
For example, a bullet could access D.you.luminence to decrease it.

Maps
All maps extend Maps.map. Maps hold entities, keep track of which maps are attached to this map, if there is a pylon on the map, etc.
